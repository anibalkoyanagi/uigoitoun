I'm interested in whether any true cults have ever emerged on Reddit. I have been following u/ChrisCGC and his sub r/cantelmoism, "the official subreddit for the newly emerged Internet religion Cantelmoism, approved by the Lord u/ChrisCGC himself!"

I'm interested in bio, chem, biotechnology, and the concept of evolution. «Четыре Лапы» — это крупнейшая сеть магазинов, насчитывает более 240 магазинов, представленных в 20 регионах России. I have heard a lot more people saying masters are useless as its (most of the time) employers just look at it as 1 to 2 years more of coursework. On top of that, when applying to jobs, most postings ask for a bachelors with X amount of experience of masters with X amount of experience. Some also ask PhD with X amount of experience or masters with X amount if experience. Simply put, people say you're usually always underqualified or overqualified. I also have heard that masters Японская косметика и бытовая химия.

I'd like some perspective on my school's issue. I don't know what to do now and I've exhausted all means. I'm not even sure if this is ok. Here's a timeline. THIS HAS CAUSED ME 2 WEEKS OF ANXIETY ATTACKS AND MENTAL BREAKDOWNS PLS SAVE ME EDIT: Best score for N level students to enter PFP is 5 points. I'm a 6 pointer when I enrolled. TLDR Singapore Poly provided wrong information and is costing my education 2017 Applied to Biomedical science via PFP placed into Non-Science Track So, today I graduated from university with a degree in Biochemistry/Biotechnology. It sounds nice but honestly I really haven't cared for the field for the last couple years and finished solely to get a glorified piece of paper. I've thought about trucking for years as a "fall back" but now I see it as a legitimate source to pay down my debt and make a decent life for myself since I really don't want to work in the science field. I know some mega carriers pay for CDL training i want to know what you guys studied or did study at uni in relation to all things drugs. Has anyone here studied biotechnology or just basic chemistry. Any information is much appreciated. IM SORRY THIS IS LONG AF! I just want some space!! I love FDH! He’s amazing and kind and supportive. We are both introverted and enjoy spending time together. His love language is touch and affection, mine is acts of kindness and words of affirmation. BG: I grew up with an abusive mother who controlled EVERYTHING. I hated being touched by her. It was like I could feel the toxic sludge of her attitude on my skin. It literally disgusted me. Especially since she’s say something like “I’m It's obviously bullshit. > the ratio of heterosexual to homosexual pedophiles was calculated to be approximately 11:1. From the National Center for Biotechnology Information. In other words, 92% of pedophiles are straight, about in line with the % of the general population that's straight. But there is pervasive thought in many conservative groups that homosexuality and pedophilia are somehow linked, when they're clearly not. It's just dumb to even mention.

I have the option to either go into chemistry or genomic biotechnology, what are your thoughts about this? Is it difficult to get a job into the genetics field? How well are they paid? If you are working in a genetic related field, are you happy? Thanks. My whole life has been me trying to find happiness (a quick look through my history can confirm that), depression, loneliness, self loathing, and failures have been consitante companions of mine. What got me through the dark moments of yesterday was hope of a better life when I got older But here I am looking at the uncaring truth. The Earth is dying, a Blue Ocean event is only a couple of years away, bees are going extinct, and the effects of ecological collapse and climate change. Zizek and Mark Fisher point to ecological crisis, proliferation of mental illness, rise in biotechnology, and modern bureaucracy as examples of a 'tear in the curtain' of capitalism ideology by which light can be shed on the next economic and epistemic boundaries. However, the remarkable and scary feat of 20th century capital is how it assimilated the proletariat into its mechanisms such that class struggle is no longer tangible. Why is especially Fisher so quick to say focus on these 'Reals'. I really enjoyed “Nosedive” and “the entire history of you” because they hit really close to home. I would enjoy seeing something to do with biotechnology. What do you think you’d enjoy seeing. Hi guys. I’m thinking about taking biotechnology as my major. What do you guys think? Is it hard? Are there careers available? Is it in high demand? I have so many questions lol I need guidance. Synthmeat, Vat-grown beef, chicken breasts grown on trees. It's all coming, and in some cases, already here. If we can grow human hearts in an apparatus using stem cells and an everflowing, oxygen rich nutrient broth, then we can grow only cow ribs without the cow. This is the bright ethical future of biotechnology, and it ought to be the anti-slaughter, ethical solution that vegans are looking for--after all, some percentage of vegans are vegans because of the cruelty and slaying My whole life has been me trying to find happiness (a quick look through my history can confirm that), depression, loneliness, self loathing, and failures have been consitante companions of mine.

I have recently finished up a four-year degree in biotechnology and have already started working for a biopharma company. I was looking into doing a masters in Bioprocess engineering part time as I am working and the company has said that they have no problem paying for it. I just keep asking myself is it worth it though? Will it open up more options for me as it would be an engineering degree? Would I see an increase in pay alone just from having a masters degree? I am really conflicted. I’m a biotechnology major and want to double major in computer engineer. It’s been four years in college and it’s getting slightly expensive. Should I do it or should I just finish my biotechnology track. #DOW Boeing (BA) (Industrials/Aerospace & Defense) – The aircraft maker has limited the role of their pilots in their 737 MAX flight-control system development, as according to sources Disney (DIS) (Communication Services/Movies & Entertainment), Sinclair Broadcasting Corp (SBGI) – Disney have come to an agreement with to sell Sinclair their 21 regional sports networks for USD 21bln (WSJ) JPMorgan (JPM) (Financials/Diversified Banks), Microsoft (MSFT) (Information Technology/Systems. So I met with a grad school advisor yesterday in regards to getting a masters in chemistry or biochemistry. I'm entering my senior year of undergrad so I've been looking into options about grad school. He basically told me that the difference between a BS program and an MS program for Chem/biochem is very minimal and would really just be a waste of time and money. This was very discouraging for me because I was really looking forward to entering a masters program. At this time in my life I canno. I need help guys I am deciding between choosing materials engineering and biotechnology. I have a passion for chemistry and lab equipment. But also love the feeling of working in a team , solving problems using critical thinking. I am interested in energy storage and constructing solar cells  But my main interest is being part of the development of biodegradable plastics. Which one is more suited? If neither , what other program should I choose. Okay, so this is going to be long. My brother just finished his sophomore year with a 2.55 GPA. It’s this low from a combination of being irresponsible (mainly in his freshman year) and also struggling with difficult classes. (He is a biotechnology major and so takes a lot of math, chemistry, etc). He has a decent work ethic but also has some anxiety, depression, issues adjusting to new situations, really poor sleep schedule, etc, that sometimes get in the way of his academics. I am a first generation college student of immigrants and in the usual fashion, I was expected to go to university, the med school. I'm now at the end of my sophomore year in attempting to get a biotechnology degree (as long as it had "bio" in it they thought it was ok) and have barely been able to pass (when I pass) the pre-requisite courses needed to apply and get accepted into my major. The only thing that has been somewhat saving my GPA is the extra required courses needed to graduate.
