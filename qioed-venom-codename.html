Outer Heaven logo ( I am a bit of a nerd and recently i decided to analyse the logo. Basically i just want to share a couple of things i found quite interesting and basically just thought some of you guys may enjoy reading. The style of design in the logo is referred to as a winged skull, evidence of it being used trace all the way back to the 15th century, and it is still used today. In present times it is most commonly associated as part of motorcycle culture. Born of the void between states of being, the Phoenix Force is a child of the universe. In the dying moments of the previous universe, the Force saved all existence from eternal damnation, enabling Eternity to preserve the humanoid Galan, ensuring his re-creation as Galactus. This documentary about Chernobyl is highly recommended. Watch it full. Has interesting S.T.A.L.K.E.R. content plus people that really likes The Zone (even a man speaks that he "fall in love" with the reactor. I have NO problem with that!) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9Ts18dxuH0 And I just found a nice OLD "GSC Game World" game, the spiritual predecessor of our favourite one ;) Played it in the past and have great moments. Amazing atmosphere! (don´t forget to read the reviews) https://. Hi guys! I’m searching for a very old game I played a long time ago. It was a demo. The level began in the woods, where you had to hide because your objective was destroying a tank passing by. You had a rifle that changed modes spanning between a chaingun, rocket launcher, granade launcher, sniper gun. and others You could hide under trees, Next mission was killing a guy on a far away tower with the sniper gun mode Thanks. Is it possible that Quiet eventually found out about Venom Snake's identity, or did she believe Platform(s): PC, I played this on Windows Millenium Edition Genre: First person shooter Estimated year of release: 1998-2001. I played this sometime in 1999-2001. Graphics/art style: 3D Graphics, realistic style Notable gameplay mechanics: The player had a single weapon that had many modes. It fired normal shots, shotgun shots, grenades, rockets, laser, and more that I do not remember Other details: I played a demo version of this game that had two levels. The first. The line 'V has come to'. Ahab is the fifth version of snake, after the original and three clones. Feel so dumb now for not picking up this twist from the very start. Edited to correct the line, point remains 
The only MGS game i played was MGSV, so i dont know what happened before much. Are they the same person or? We play with Big Boss in MGSV right? edit: thank So, I'm still confused why is Big Boss is called punished 'venom' snake? This is the last question I have and then I'll be all caught So you know. Ahab, aka Venom, aka Big Boss's Phantom, aka Medic, aka the man who fiddled us all, etc. I have some questions about him that I hope some of you could help me with. 1- After Paz explode and the chopper crash, how did he survive the blast + crash + big ass bone piercing his skull + losing an arm + the journey to the hospital which is around 320Km away which would take at least around an hour IN a chopper moving at 400km/h. And with all that, he didn't

TLDR: I'm looking for 1E Pathfinder builds for supervillains for my players to fight in our superhero-themed homebrew campaign; any monster, PC race, class, archetypes, and magic items are considered. If you also come up with backstory and a cheesy/awesome villain codename, all the better. amp#x200B; Ever since the Vigilante class came out, I've been thinking about how I can use Pathfinder to make a superhero-themed campaign. Now, I'm sure you're asking "why don't you just play Mutants. In all honesty, I don't get it. I have heard alot of disappointed people talk about it as if it's some massive deal. My biggest issue was that people honestly thought it was Big Boss. I remember the lead up to the game and just thinking the whole time that it wasn't him. Aside from the fact that he didn't have the scarring Venom Snake had when he appeared in mgs4, he also wasn't wearing a relatively noisy prosthetic, or have a huge glass shard in his head, and I will make the argument personal. This is gonna be long as hell so be warned. •The story •Peter and MJ are living together with peter planning to propose to her soon. •Peter has turned Octavius industries into a “spider cave” type area for him and Miles to operate out of.
